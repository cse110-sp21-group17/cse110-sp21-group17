# Decision for which JS Framework to use

## Date
05/04/2021

## Status 
depricated (Frameworks not allowed for this project)

## Context 
Our group needed to decide which JavaScript framework we would build our project off of.

## Decision
Using ReactJS to build project.

## Consequences
- Everyone on the team must take some time to learn ReactJS as no one has prior experience.
- Many consider JSX, the syntax extension React uses, as a disadvantage because it combines HTML with JavaScript.
- ReactJS is known for not having good documentation.
