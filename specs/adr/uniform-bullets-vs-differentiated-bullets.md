## Context
In terms of how we would categorize our bullets in our journal, our team came upon a crossroad of 
either treating each entry the same and denotationg them all with a bullet. The other option, was for 
us to follow the more traditional approach of bullet journals, and have the tasks, events and notes. 
Arguments for the single bllet style were that it would reduce the complexity of our app for users 
ad could streamline data entry. Agruments for the other option were that the creator of the bullet journal 
had those three types into an already minimalistic system, and haveing three options while entering data 
is not that much more complexity.

## Decision
We decided to go with the multiple differentiated bullets. The team felt that htis offered users more flexibility to follow the original bullet format as designed by the creator, while also accomidating the minimalists as they can simply put everything in as a task and accomplish the same thing by having a journal that is composed of uniform bullets.

## Consequences
- Our team will now have to implement a system that is composed of a custom element that can be modified further depending on the context.
- Our team will have to style all of the different types of entries to make a cohesive page. 
- Finally, our team will have to create icons for each of the different types of bullets.
