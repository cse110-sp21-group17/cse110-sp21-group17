# Panes vs Multiple Pages

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Everyone
* Date: 2021-05-01

## Context and Problem Statement

In terms of overarching design, our group needed to deicde if we are creating a single static page with 
multiple panes that get updated or if we are creating a site that uses multiple pages and will be constantly 
updating the page that the user sees.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* The user should feel more anchored in our site and navigation should feel easier. 
* Memory managent will be much more important as memory is not getting wiped everytime a new page opens.
* The team needs to develop a system of grabbing the correct journal entry and displaying it to the Pane.

## Considered Options

* Static 
* Dynamic

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Static page implementation

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Static

* Good, because navigating between pages will be faster for the user

### Dynamic

* Bad, because the digital BUJO would not work as well as an app
