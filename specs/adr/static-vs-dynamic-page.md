# Panes vs Multiple Pages

## Date
05/01/2021

## Status 
Accepted

## Context 
In terms of overarching design, our group needed to deicde if we are creating a single static page with 
multiple panes that get updated or if we are creating a site that uses multiple pages and will be constantly 
updating the page that the user sees.

## Decision
Static page implementation

## Consequences
- The user should feel more anchored in our site and navigation should feel easier. 
- Memory managent will be much more important as memory is not getting wiped everytime a new page opens.
- The team needs to develop a system of grabbing the correct journal entry and displaying it to the Pane.
