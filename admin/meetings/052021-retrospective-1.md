# May 20, 2021 Meeting Retrospective

## 5:50pm-6:30pm, remote on zoom

### members who attended
1. Pablo Gratas
2. Juan Ding
3. Enzo Han
4. Andrew Martinez
5. Alec Smith
6. David Cao

### Analysis of results
- David: Focus time is difficult for everyone
- Pablo: tool reliability is a challange, sometimes software stops working
- Alec: Time managment is hard without shared, specific coding time as a team
- Andrew: Remote learning is a major challenge; social aspect is really broken

### Discussion about what did and didn't go well
- Pablo: Tasks should be more focused, more specific individual tasks and less general multi-person jobs
- Jenny: Not enough tasks have been assigned; long periods of having no work assigned to do
- Alec: Also interested in getting more progress and tasks done
- David: Trust in leadership to assign the extra tasks when assigned; try synchronous hours, more discussions need to happen async on Slack as opposed to using so much valuable zoom meeting time
- Andrew: Leadership should just assign tasks instead of asking, more efficient
- Enzo: In agreement with previous sentiments

### Action Plan:
- Managers - move everyone along during meetings lmao
- Make better use of the Slack channels - tangents go there
- Schedule synchronous work hours
- Don't say "anyone want to do __," instead "you do __"
- Assign tasks more evenly - we're behind since we don't have too many tasks assigned to specific people.
- Assign specific tasks to individuals vs assigning general tasks to groups: "Note object" is a one-person job, ADR for this is a one-person job, etc.

### What went well:
- Good meetings
- Consistent meetings
- Relevant discussion
- Progress is being shared

### What didn't go well:
- Too much talk, not enough code
- Task clarity and delegation hasn't been sufficiently clear
- Spotty progress
- Meetings often went overtime without hitting important points
