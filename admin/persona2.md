Story:

Pablo a hard working UCSD student. He wakes up on a Monday morning opening his laptop,
then opens his favorite app (name of our app).  
First, he looks at his goals to gain inspiration. Second, he 
writes down some notes about the test he has this week.
Thirdly, he checks his task for today. Finally, he checks if 
which events are coming up. He sees an exam on the horizon, he knows it's all over now.
